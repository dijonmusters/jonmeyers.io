      In this series, we look at building a Remix application with a Supabase
      back-end.
    </p>

    <p>
      We cover:
      <ul>
        <li>creating a Supabase client on both the client and server</li>
        <li>using environment variables</li>
        <li>authentication and cookies</li>
        <li>authorization with Row Level Security (RLS) policies</li>
        <li>
          subscribing to realtime events to update the UI when data changes in
          Supabase.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
